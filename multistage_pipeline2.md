# 🌊 Multistage Pipeline in DevOps

This README explains the key concepts behind building a multistage pipeline in Azure DevOps for deploying a static web application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Docker and Kubernetes.

---

## 1) What is a multistage pipeline?

A multistage pipeline is a DevOps practice where a single YAML file defines **multiple distinct stages** of a CI/CD process. Each stage represents a logical phase, such as:

- **Build** → Compiles code, builds container images
- **Test** → Runs unit/integration tests
- **Deploy** → Pushes code to testing or production environments

Each stage can run jobs in sequence or in parallel. This structure brings better organization, control, and visibility to complex deployments — especially across environments (e.g., testing, staging, production).

## 2) What is a service principal?

A service principal is a **security identity** used by applications, services, or automation tools (like Azure DevOps) to access Azure resources. It behaves like a “user” but is meant for non-human tasks.

When you create an Azure Resource Manager or Kubernetes service connection in Azure DevOps, a service principal is often used under the hood to:

- Authenticate with Azure
- Perform operations like deployments, scaling, etc.

## 3) What is Kubernetes manifests?

Kubernetes manifests are **YAML configuration files** that describe the desired state of objects in your cluster. Examples include:

- Deployments (define app containers, replicas, etc.)
- Services (expose apps internally or externally)
- Ingress (routes traffic)
- ConfigMaps, Secrets, Volumes, etc.

These manifests are applied to the cluster using tools like `kubectl` or the `Kubernetes@1` task in Azure DevOps.

## 4) When creating AKS in Azure Portal, it gives so many options. Explain all.

When creating an AKS cluster via Azure Portal, you'll see multiple configuration sections:

- **Basics**: Choose subscription, resource group, cluster name, region, and Kubernetes version
- **Node pools**: Define VM size, scaling settings, and OS type for worker nodes
- **Authentication**: Configure admin access, Azure AD integration, or RBAC
- **Networking**: Set up network plugins (Azure/CNI), DNS, IP ranges, and virtual networks
- **Integrations**: Options to enable Azure Monitor, Container Insights, Defender, and log analytics
- **Tags**: Add metadata for management and billing

Each setting plays a role in how your cluster performs, scales, and integrates with the rest of Azure.

## 5) What is nginx, alpine?

- **nginx** is a lightweight, high-performance web server often used to serve static files like HTML, CSS, JS, or act as a reverse proxy.
- **alpine** refers to Alpine Linux — a super minimal, secure, and fast Linux distribution commonly used as a base image in Docker. The image `nginx:alpine` is simply NGINX running on Alpine Linux, making it ideal for fast, efficient containerization.

---

## 6) Why do we create deployment.yaml and service.yaml in manifests?

- **deployment.yaml** defines the **Kubernetes Deployment**, which:
  - Describes how many replicas (pods) to run
  - Specifies the container image and port
  - Ensures pods are self-healing and updated when configurations change

- **service.yaml** defines the **Kubernetes Service**, which:
  - Exposes the deployment to the network
  - Can be internal (ClusterIP) or external (LoadBalancer)
  - Routes traffic to pods based on labels

Keeping them in a `manifests/` folder keeps your repo organized and makes the structure consistent across environments.

---

## 7) What do we mean by Expose AKS App with LoadBalancer?

Exposing with a LoadBalancer means:

- Creating a Kubernetes Service of type `LoadBalancer`
- Azure provisions an external IP and routes HTTP traffic to your pods
- This is how you access the app via a public URL (e.g., http://<external-ip>)

It acts as a bridge between your private Kubernetes workload and the public internet.

## ✅ Recommended Project Structure

Here’s how your repo should look:

/
├── site/                      # Your static HTML files (already exists)  
│   └── index.html  
│  
├── manifests/                 # New folder to store K8s YAML files  
│   ├── deployment.yaml        # K8s Deployment file  
│   └── service.yaml           # K8s Service file  
│  
├── Dockerfile                 # Dockerfile for AKS deployment  
├── azure-pipelines.yml        # Your DevOps pipeline  

- The first Kubernetes@1 task deploys the container (from Docker Hub)  
- The second Kubernetes@1 task exposes the app using service.yaml

## 🧠 Bonus Learnings (Related to Practical Execution)

- We used the `latest` tag in Docker images for simplicity
- Faced an image pull error due to invalid tag formatting — resolved by switching to `latest`
- Used Azure DevOps service connections to automate secure deployments
- Verified deployment success via AKS External IP and pod logs
